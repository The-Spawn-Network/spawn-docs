## **üõ†Ô∏è Extending Spawn with Custom Tools**

Spawn is **highly extensible**, allowing developers to integrate **custom tools, APIs, and external functionalities** directly into the platform. This enables **enhanced automation, data retrieval, and AI-driven interactions**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview of Custom Tool Integration**

Custom tools in Spawn operate as **modular plug-ins** that can be used to:

- **Enhance AI Agents** with domain-specific capabilities.
- **Connect external APIs** for real-time data access.
- **Automate tasks** using predefined workflows.
- **Modify responses** dynamically based on external conditions.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Custom Tool**

Custom tools in Spawn are defined as **JSON-configured modules** that can be dynamically attached to AI agents.

#### **üìå Example Tool Configuration (JSON)**

```json
{
  "name": "WeatherFetcher",
  "description": "Retrieves real-time weather data",
  "trigger": "user_request",
  "api_endpoint": "https://api.weather.com/v1/",
  "parameters": {
    "location": "string",
    "unit": "metric"
  },
  "response_format": "json"
}
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Registering a Custom Tool**

To register a tool, add it to the **Spawn tool registry** via API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.thespawnnetwork.com/tools/register" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @tool-config.json
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Calling Custom Tools in AI Agents**

Agents can invoke tools dynamically during conversations:

```json
{
  "agent": "WeatherBot",
  "message": "What's the weather in New York?",
  "tool": "WeatherFetcher",
  "response": "The current temperature in New York is 12¬∞C with clear skies."
}
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Tool Execution Flow**

1. **User input triggers the tool.**
2. **Spawn sends a request to the registered API.**
3. **The tool processes the data and returns results.**
4. **The AI agent incorporates the response into the conversation.**

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Considerations**

- All custom tools are **sandboxed** to prevent unauthorized access.
- API calls are **rate-limited** to ensure fair usage.
- Data is **encrypted** to maintain privacy and security.

‚úÖ **Outcome:** Custom tools **enhance AI agents** with **specialized functionalities**, making Spawn adaptable to **various industries and applications**.
