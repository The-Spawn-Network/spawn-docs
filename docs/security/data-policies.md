## **📜 Data Handling Policies in Spawn**

Spawn is designed with a **privacy-first** architecture, ensuring that **no personally identifiable information (PII) is stored or processed beyond its operational scope**. The platform follows **strict data minimization principles**, making it compliant with global data privacy regulations.

🔹 **Stateless Processing**: No long-term storage of user interactions  
🔹 **Ephemeral Data Lifecycle**: Temporary in-memory processing  
🔹 **Zero-Retention by Default**: Data is not logged unless explicitly enabled  
🔹 **Configurable Data Retention Policies**

---

## **1️⃣ Temporary & In-Memory Data Processing**

All user interactions within Spawn are processed **ephemerally**, meaning data exists **only during active use** and is not stored persistently.

**🔹 Key Features of the Ephemeral Data Model:**

✅ **No Database Storage of User Inputs or Outputs**  
✅ **Memory-Based Data Processing** (deleted once processed)  
✅ **Stateless API Transactions**

### **🔹 How Ephemeral Processing Works**

1️⃣ A user sends a request (e.g., a chat message or code execution)  
2️⃣ The request is processed in memory **without persistent storage**  
3️⃣ The response is generated and sent back to the user  
4️⃣ **Data is immediately discarded after processing**

**Example of an In-Memory Processing Model in FastAPI:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import time

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/process")
def process_request(payload: dict):
    response = {"status": "processed", "timestamp": time.time()}
    return response  # Data is discarded after response
```

## **2️⃣ Data Retention & Logging Policies**

Spawn provides **configurable logging and data retention policies**, allowing administrators to **customize how long (if at all) data is retained**.

**🔹 Default Policy:**  
🔻 **Logging Disabled** (Zero-Retention Mode)  
🔻 **No User Data Stored in Databases**  
🔻 **In-Memory Processing Only**

### **Enforcing Zero-Log Mode**

For **Docker-based deployments**, ensure that logging is completely disabled:

```sh
SPAWN_LOG_LEVEL=CRITICAL
SPAWN_ZERO_RETAIN=true
```

For **FastAPI-based deployments**, explicitly disable logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)  # No logs saved
```

✅ **With these settings, no user interactions will be logged or stored.**

---

## **3️⃣ Optional Data Retention for Analytics**

For advanced **usage analytics and system debugging**, Spawn allows optional logging **without storing user inputs**.

🔹 **Options for Data Retention:**  
1️⃣ **Fully Ephemeral Mode (Default)** – No storage  
2️⃣ **Minimal Retention Mode** – Store only metadata (e.g., request volume, system load)  
3️⃣ **Audit Mode (Optional)** – Store API request logs **without PII**

Example: Enabling **metadata-only** logging:

```sh
SPAWN_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
SPAWN_RETAIN_METADATA=true
```

Sample FastAPI logger that **stores only request metadata, not content:**

```python
from fastapi import Request
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("spawn-logs")

@app.middleware("http")
async def log_requests(request: Request, call_next):
    logger.info(f"Request received from {request.client.host} at {request.url}")
    response = await call_next(request)
    return response
```

## **4️⃣ Compliance with Global Privacy Laws**

Spawn adheres to **GDPR, CCPA, and other global data privacy standards** by enforcing:

✅ **Data Minimization** (Collect only what's necessary)  
✅ **Explicit Consent Mechanisms** (For optional data collection)  
✅ **Right to Be Forgotten** (User data is never stored)  
✅ **Anonymized Logging** (No user-identifiable information)

### **Privacy Compliance Configuration**

For deployments in **regulated environments**, enforce strict privacy policies via environment variables:

```sh
SPAWN_GDPR_MODE=true
SPAWN_USER_OPT_OUT=true
```

---

## **🔐 Conclusion**

Spawn’s **data policies** are designed for **maximum security and privacy**. By default, **no user data is retained**, and all processing is **ephemeral and in-memory**. Optional metadata logging can be enabled for **analytics purposes**, but user interaction data is **never stored**.
