## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Processing Architecture**

Spawn‚Äôs **image handling engine** processes images through a **multi-stage pipeline** that ensures **efficiency, accuracy, and security**.

### **Processing Stages**

| Stage                   | Function                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preprocessing**       | Resizes, normalizes, and optimizes images for analysis.       |
| **Face Detection**      | Identifies human faces in images using AI models.             |
| **Object Recognition**  | Detects objects, text, and patterns within images.            |
| **AI Model Invocation** | Routes request to the best AI model for image classification. |
| **Result Refinement**   | Enhances and formats output for clarity.                      |

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Facial Recognition & Detection**

Spawn utilizes **state-of-the-art AI models** to **detect human faces** in uploaded images, ensuring **accurate processing and verification**.

### **Face Detection Flow**

1. **User uploads an image.**
2. **Spawn analyzes the image** for facial features.
3. **If no face is detected**, the user is prompted to upload another image.
4. **If a face is detected**, the image is processed and stored securely.

### **Example API Workflow**

```json
{
  "input_image": "base64_encoded_image",
  "operation": "face-detection",
  "threshold": 0.85
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "faces_detected": 1,
  "bounding_boxes": [[120, 45, 200, 180]]
}
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Model Selection for Image Processing**

Spawn dynamically selects **the best AI model** based on **image complexity, requested operation, and optimization level**.

### **Supported Models & Use Cases**

‚úÖ **Face Detection** ‚Üí **Google Vision, DeepFace, OpenCV**  
‚úÖ **Object Recognition** ‚Üí **YOLOv8, CLIP, DeepSeek Vision**  
‚úÖ **Text Extraction (OCR)** ‚Üí **Tesseract OCR, PaddleOCR**  
‚úÖ **AI-Generated Captions** ‚Üí **BLIP, Gemini Vision, GPT-4o**

### **Example: Object Recognition Request**

```json
{
  "input_image": "base64_encoded_image",
  "operation": "object-recognition",
  "model": "yolov8"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "objects_detected": ["laptop", "desk", "person"],
  "confidence_scores": [0.98, 0.95, 0.99]
}
```

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Image Upload & Processing via Cloud Storage**

Spawn **automatically uploads images to Cloudinary** after passing **security checks**, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

### **Image Upload Workflow**

1. **User uploads an image.**
2. **Spawn checks for facial detection** (if required).
3. **Image is uploaded to Cloudinary** for secure storage.
4. **The Cloudinary URL is returned** for further processing.

### **Example API Call to Upload Image**

```json
{
  "input_image": "base64_encoded_image",
  "operation": "upload"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "cloudinary_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/spawn/image/upload/sample.jpg"
}
```
