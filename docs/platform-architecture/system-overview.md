## **üõ†Ô∏è System Overview**

Spawn is built as a **modular, high-performance AI agent platform** designed for scalability, security, and real-time interactions. It integrates **AI models, multimodal processing, embeddable agents, and code execution** into a seamless framework.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Architecture**

Spawn follows a **microservices-based architecture**, consisting of:

- **Frontend**: A Next.js-based UI for managing agents and interactions.
- **Backend API**: A FastAPI-powered service handling AI processing, agent logic, and API requests.
- **Database Layer**: A PostgreSQL database with `pgvector` for efficient embedding retrieval.
- **AI Model Abstraction**: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Eleven Labs, and more through a unified API.
- **Execution Engine**: A sandboxed code execution environment for AI-driven script execution.
- **Security Layer**: Anonymity-first design ensuring user privacy and data protection.
