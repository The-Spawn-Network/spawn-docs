## **🔐 Security & Privacy in Spawn**

Spawn is designed with **anonymity-first architecture**, ensuring **secure, private**, and **compliant AI interactions** while minimizing exposure of sensitive data. The platform enforces **end-to-end security** across all **agent communications, model interactions, and data processing pipelines**.

---

## **1️⃣ Anonymous Interaction Framework**

Spawn operates on a **zero-identity architecture**, meaning:
✅ No user accounts are required for standard interactions.  
✅ AI conversations remain stateless unless explicitly configured to store context.  
✅ Agents communicate using **session-based encryption** without persisting PII (Personally Identifiable Information).  
✅ Custom deployments can opt for **ephemeral memory**, ensuring no long-term data retention.

Example **Anonymous Session Token**:

```json
{
  "session_id": "4f87a2d1-9c4f-402d-bb99-1d469d3b25d6",
  "expires_at": "2025-02-01T12:00:00Z",
  "permissions": ["text-processing", "audio-processing"]
}
```

If session expiration is enabled, user sessions are automatically destroyed after **N minutes** of inactivity.

---

## **2️⃣ Data Storage & Processing Policies**

Spawn follows a **minimal-data policy**:

- **No Persistent User Data**: Conversations are only stored when explicitly enabled.
- **Real-Time Anonymization**: Sensitive data is redacted before being sent to AI models.
- **On-Premise & Self-Hosting**: Enterprises can deploy Spawn **entirely within their infrastructure**, ensuring full data control.

#### **🔒 In-Transit & At-Rest Encryption**

- **TLS 1.3** Encryption secures all network communications.
- **AES-256** Encryption protects stored API keys and credentials.
- **HMAC-SHA256** Signed Requests prevent tampering and replay attacks.

Example **Encrypted API Request**:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "spawn-agent-xyz",
  "query": "What is quantum entanglement?",
  "timestamp": 1706822400,
  "signature": "a3f5b6c8e92d..."
}
```

A valid signature ensures that only **authorized requests** interact with the AI models.

## **3️⃣ Compliance with Global Data Privacy Standards**

Spawn ensures compliance with **major data privacy frameworks**, including:

| Compliance Framework        | Status                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **GDPR (EU)**               | ✅ Compliant                    |
| **CCPA (California, USA)**  | ✅ Compliant                    |
| **SOC 2 Type II**           | ✅ Enterprise-Ready             |
| **HIPAA (Healthcare Data)** | ✅ Optional Encryption Support  |
| **ISO/IEC 27001**           | ✅ Security Framework Adherence |

Enterprise users can **disable cloud-based AI models** and route requests exclusively through **self-hosted models** for full compliance.

## **4️⃣ Threat Mitigation Strategies**

Spawn incorporates **multiple layers of security defenses**:

🔐 **Rate Limiting & API Quotas** – Prevents bot abuse and DDoS attacks.  
🛡️ **Real-Time Threat Detection** – Monitors for malicious inputs (prompt injections, jailbreaks).  
🔑 **Scoped API Keys** – Restricts AI model access per agent.  
📊 **Audit Logging & Monitoring** – Provides forensic visibility into API usage.

Example **Rate-Limited API Key**:

```json
{
  "api_key": "sk-abcdef123456",
  "rate_limit": "1000 requests/day",
  "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o", "claude-3"]
}
```

A rate-limited key ensures **controlled access** to AI resources.

---

## **5️⃣ Secure AI Model Execution (Sandboxing & Isolation)**

Spawn prevents **model manipulation** through:

✔️ **Sandboxed Code Execution** – No access to host OS or external files.  
✔️ **Input Validation & Sanitization** – Prevents AI model exploits.  
✔️ **Strict API Permissions** – Models can only access allowed resources.  
✔️ **Audit Logs for AI Decisions** – Ensures AI transparency & accountability.

Example **AI Execution Sandbox**:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "run-xyz",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "restricted_functions": ["os.system", "exec"],
  "memory_limit": "512MB"
}
```

Models are **prevented** from running unsafe operations.
