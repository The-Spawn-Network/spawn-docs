# **Deploying Spawn AI Agents**

## **Overview**

Spawn agents are designed for flexible deployment across multiple environments, including web applications, cloud services, and enterprise platforms. The deployment process ensures agents are optimized for performance, security, and scalability.

## **Deployment Options**

Spawn AI agents can be deployed using one of the following methods:

1. **Standalone Deployment** ‚Äì Hosted directly via Spawn's cloud infrastructure.
2. **Embedded Deployment** ‚Äì Integrated within third-party applications via embeddable links or iFrames.
3. **On-Premise Deployment** ‚Äì Self-hosted on custom infrastructure with full data control.
4. **API-Based Deployment** ‚Äì Interacting with Spawn agents programmatically through the API.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Standalone Deployment (Hosted by Spawn)**

Spawn provides a **fully managed** environment where AI agents can be deployed instantly.

### **Steps to Deploy:**

1. **Create an AI Agent** in the Spawn dashboard.
2. **Train and Configure** the agent with necessary tools, integrations, and settings.
3. **Set Up Access Control** (public, restricted, or private).
4. **Deploy the Agent** ‚Äì The agent will be live at a generated Spawn URL.

Example Deployment URL:

```
https://thespawnnetwork.com/agents/{agent_id}
```

This method ensures **zero maintenance**, automatic scaling, and built-in security.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Embedded Deployment**

AI agents can be **embedded within web applications** using iFrames or JavaScript widgets.

### **Using an iFrame**

```html
<iframe
  src="https://thespawnnetwork.com/embed/your-agent-id"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  style="border:none;"
>
</iframe>
```

### **Using JavaScript Widget**

```javascript
const spawnContainer = document.getElementById('spawn-agent')
spawnContainer.innerHTML = `<iframe src="https://thespawnnetwork.com/embed/your-agent-id" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>`
```

This method allows quick **frontend integration** with minimal backend involvement.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ On-Premise Deployment (Self-Hosted)**

For enterprises requiring **data privacy** and **custom infrastructure**, Spawn supports self-hosted deployment.

### **Prerequisites:**

- **Docker & Docker Compose**

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Run the containerized services**:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the agent locally**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### **Scaling Self-Hosted Deployments**

For production, use:

- **Load balancing** (Nginx, HAProxy)
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **Autoscaling based on requests**

    "rate_limit": 10
  }
}
```

### **Example API Response**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "deployment_url": "https://thespawnnetwork.com/api/agents/customer-support-bot",
  "api_key": "abcd1234"
}
```

API deployments allow **direct integration** with business workflows, mobile apps, and third-party automation.
